<h2>Notes to developers</h2>

<p>If you are interested in contributing code you might find useful
to know the rules I try to follow while writing code. All the code
will be Java 6, written mostly using the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html">Sun Java coding conventions</a>.
One difference is the use of two space indents (instead of four). No tabs
shall be used (this is unspecified by Sun). One rule commonly forgot that I care
about is to "avoid lines longer than 80 characters." OK, enough with the
boring stuff. Now on to (slightly) less religious decisions. One form
of external dependency allowed is a <tt>jar</tt> file in the <tt>lib</tt>
directory. Developers will also need <tt>ant</tt> and <tt>junit</tt>.
No other external dependency is allowed. The commands <tt>ant</tt>, 
<tt>ant test</tt>, and <tt>ant doc</tt> should always work in the 
repository.</p>
