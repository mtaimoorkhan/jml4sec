<p>Data structures for representing the abstract syntax tree of BoogiePL.</p>

<p><b>Author</b>: rgrig, reviewed by NAME (DATE)</p>


<h2>Principles</h2>

<ul>
<li>few AST nodes
<li>support pretty print and verbose dump for debug
<li>must be able to parse/print programs and program fragments (expr, stmt)
<li>must read from both streams and strings (TODO: is there a stream
   wrapper around a string?)
<li>good location tracking for error reporting
</ul>

<p>NOTE: <a href="http://manju.cs.berkeley.edu/cil/">CIL</a> has a pretty 
  good design. I will borrow heavily from that.</p>

<h2>The abstract grammar</h2>

<p>The AST is kept as flat as possible.</p>

<p>
The abstract syntax is described using the following language.
An inheritance rule <tt>A :> B, C</tt> means that classes <code>B</code>
and <code>C</code> are derived from <code>A</code>. The composition rule
<code>A = B f1, C f2</code> means that class <code>A</code> has a field
<code>f1</code> of type <code>B</code> and a field <code>f2</code> fo type
<code>C</code>. In this context a type (<code>B</code> or <code>C</code>)
can have the special form <tt>enum(ENUM_NAME: VAL1, VAL2, ...)</tt>.
All the values corresponding to a certain enum name (there might be more than
one occurence of the name!) appear in an enum declaration embedded in the
current class. A type name followed by an exclamation mark means that 
that reference must be non-null.
</p>

<p>
The data structures are functional. The lists are implemented in the usual
head/tail (or singly linked, depending on where you come from) style. There
are no setter methods.

// This is the abstract grammar for FreeBoogie used to generate
// the AST. See also the template (*.tpl) files.

// TODO: there is some repetition here (the tail). Make the
// code generator smarter

// The program is a (functional) list of (global) declarations
Declaration :> TypeDecl, ConstDecl, Function, Axiom, 
               VariableDecl, Procedure, Implementation;

TypeDecl =     String! name, Declaration tail;
ConstDecl=     String! id, Type! type, Declaration tail;
Function =     Signature! sig, Declaration tail;
Axiom =        Expr! expr, Declaration tail;
VariableDecl = String name, Type! type, Declaration tail;
Procedure =    Signature! sig, Specification spec, Declaration tail;
Implementation = Signature! sig, Body! body, Declaration tail;


// Types and constants
Type :> PrimitiveType, UserType, ArrayType, GenericType, DepType, TupleType;
ArrayType = Type! rowType, Type colType, Type! elemType;
PrimitiveType = enum(Ptype: BOOL, INT, REF, NAME, ANY, ERROR) ptype;
GenericType = Type! param, Type! type;
DepType = Type! type, Expr! pred;
UserType = String! name;
TupleType = Type! type, TupleType tail;
  // Not constructed during parsing.
  // In BoogiePL equal(TupleType(t,null), t).
  // The alternative is to put tails on all types but that looked
  // much more invasive that this solution which affects only one
  // place in the typechecker (roughly) in an ugly way.
  

// Signatures are used to represent uninterpreted functions
Signature = String! name, Declaration args, Declaration results;

// Procedures and implementations
Specification = enum(SpecType: REQUIRES, MODIFIES, ENSURES) type,
                Expr! expr, boolean free, Specification tail;
Body = Declaration vars, Block blocks;
Block = String! name, Commands cmds, BlockEnd! end, Block tail;
BlockEnd = enum(BlockType: GOTO, RETURN) type, Identifiers dest;

// Commands
Commands = Command! cmd, Commands tail;
Command :> AssignmentCmd, AssertAssumeCmd, HavocCmd, CallCmd;
AssignmentCmd = Expr! lhs, Expr! rhs; // TODO: define exactly what lhs can be
AssertAssumeCmd = enum(CmdType: ASSERT, ASSUME) type, Expr! expr;
HavocCmd = AtomId! id;
CallCmd = String! procedure, Identifiers results, Exprs args;

// Expressions
Expr :> BinaryOp, UnaryOp, Atom, Exprs;
BinaryOp = enum(Op: PLUS, MINUS, MUL, DIV, MOD, EQ, NEQ, LT, LE,
                    GE, GT, SUBTYPE, EQUIV, IMPLIES, AND, OR) op,
           Expr! left, Expr! right;
UnaryOp = enum(Op: MINUS, NOT) op, Expr! e;
Atom :> AtomLit, AtomNum, AtomId, AtomFun, AtomOld, AtomCast, AtomQuant, AtomIdx;
AtomLit = enum(AtomType: FALSE, TRUE, NULL) val;
AtomNum = BigInteger val;
AtomId = String! id;
AtomFun = String! function, Exprs args;
AtomOld = Expr! e;
AtomCast = Expr! e, Type! type;
AtomQuant = enum(QuantType: EXISTS, FORALL) quant, Declaration! vars,
            Trigger trig, Expr! e;
AtomIdx = Atom! atom, Index! idx;
Index = Expr! a, Expr b;

// Some simple lists
Trigger = String label, Exprs! exprs, Trigger tail;
Identifiers = AtomId! id, Identifiers tail;
Exprs = Expr! expr, Exprs tail;

// TODO: the invariants
Specification: type==Type.MODIFIES ==> \typeof(expr)==AtomId

</pre>

<p>The invariants specified for classes are delimited by the end of the
line, not by semicolons. This way you are free to use semicolons when
writing them. In fact, everything up to the end of the line is considered
as just text by the code generator in {@code freeboogie.ast.gen}, but
we will typically use JML invariants.</p>
