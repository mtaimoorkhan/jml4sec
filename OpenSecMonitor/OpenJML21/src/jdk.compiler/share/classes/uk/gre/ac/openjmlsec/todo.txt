Getting it working in eclipse

Signals/alrams generated code is wrong
action?



//@ public normal_behavior
//@ requires b != 0;
//@ ensures \result == a / b;
//@ also compromised_behavior
//@ requires b == 0;
//@ alarms "injection" isInjection(b);
//@ action "injection" System.out.println("injection was caught");
//@ action "injection" b = 1;
//@ ensures \result == a / 1;
//@ also exceptional_behavior
//@ requires a < 0;
//@ signals (RuntimeException) isNeg(a);

if (isInjection(b)){
	System.out.println("injection was caught");
	b = 1;
}
if (isNeg(a)){
	throw new RuntimeException();
}
